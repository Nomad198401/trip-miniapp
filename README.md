# Telegram e-Residency Miniapp

This repository contains a minimal example of a Telegram WebApp integrating
the [eâ€‘Residency](https://e-resident.gov.ee/) portal. The miniapp loads the
portal in an iframe when the user clicks a button. It demonstrates how to
interact with Telegram's JavaScript API to display a button and close the
web app.

## Running locally

Open `index.html` in a browser or deploy it to a web server. To use it as
a Telegram miniapp, host the files over HTTPS and register the URL in
Telegram's bot settings.
